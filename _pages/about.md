Hi, my name is Saijie Lu. Since graduating in 2018, I first worked at H3C as a developer focusing on the control plane of network SDN controllers. 
I primarily utilized technologies such as Java, ODL, and OpenFlow. 
After working there for four years, I joined China Mobile, where I worked on the development of forwarding features using P4 and partially contributed to the development of the SONiC network operating system.
Currently, I am particularly interested in cloud computing networks and I hope to have an opportunity to further my expertise in this field.
